		<ul>
			<li>Try the "shake and go" method. Many styles need only a good shake or finger styling and they're ready to wear.</li>
			<li>For tight curly or ringlet styles, just give the wig a vigorous shake, then gently lift and separate the curls with a pick comb or your fingers. DO NOT BRUSH.</li>
			<li>For wavy styles with loose curls, brush lightly with a wig styling brush or pick comb using short, lifting strokes - just enough to relax the style.</li>
			<li>For long curly styles use your fingers or a pick comb to gently lift and separate the curls. DO NOT BRUSH.</li>
			<li>For straight styles brush in long, even, gentle strokes from the crown to the ends for a smooth, sleek look.</li>
			<li>After each wearing, spray the ends of your wig with wig conditioner. Gently remove any tangles.</li>
