					<h3>From a young lady who loves full hair</h3>
					<p><span class="icon-quote-left"></span>I’m not suffering hair loss actually, I was just born with thinning hair. Maybe it’s human’s nature to pursue what they don’t have, I’m always longing for thick and long hair. It was my best friend Amy who recommended UniWigs to me. She happened to purchase from UniWigs store at Amazon and found that UniWigs has its own site and selling all kinds of wigs, hair extensions and hair pieces. She was totally satisfied with UniWigs products and customer service, so she told me to try their hair extensions since she knew that I would like to try any hair that would give thickness to my thinning hair. It came out great! I easily found my color and length, and the hair actually feels really really soft with the proper density. I’m impressed with this brand and would like more people to know it-UNIWIGS!<span class="icon-quote-right"></span></p>

					<h3>From a young lady suffering alopecia areata</h3>
					<p><span class="icon-quote-left"></span>I was found a small bald area on the back of my head near my crown at a party of my bbfs, I was shocked at this because I was just 25 at that time. I even didn’t have a boyfriend then and was looking for a job to make a living, I never thought I would get this... And then I went to my doctor friend, and he told me it was alopecia areata... I had to find a way to cover it before it’s getting better so I could find the job. Then I came across UniWigs, a wig brand. Their mono top hair pieces is really cool and the cooler thing is, I can find the color to match my hair. It’s made with real remy human hair and they help me choose the right size. I got the package in 3 there days after they helped me with the order, and it was amazing! Nobody found that I wore a hair piece and it was really comfortable as I totally forgot I had a bald patch on my head.... Thank you UNIWIGS for helping me find my confidence back.<span class="icon-quote-right"></span></p>

					<h3>From a lady with severe hair loss</h3>
					<p><span class="icon-quote-left"></span>My hair started to fall out badly about 4 years ago, I’m 52 now. I started to wear UniWigs since last June when I changed different wig companies again and again, because either they didn’t have my hair color, or their cap construction and their hair quality didn’t satisfy me, while UniWigs actually gives me the best mono wigs. Their wigs come in different colors and I love their cap with mono base, and most importantly, the hair is really silky soft and with high quality. I really love UniWigs and would like to recommend them to my community and my friends who need these mono wigs for their sensitive scalp!<span class="icon-quote-right"></span></p>
