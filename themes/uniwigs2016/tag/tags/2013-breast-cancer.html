				<h2>What Is Breast Cancer?</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<div class="fl">
						<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/01.jpg">
					</div>
					<p>Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that develops from breast cells. Breast cancer usually starts off in the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply them with milk. A malignant tumor can spread to other parts of the body. A breast cancer that started off in the lobules is known as lobular carcinoma, while one that developed from the ducts is called ductal carcinoma.</p>
					<p>Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in females worldwide. It accounts 
for 16% of all female cancers and 22.9% of invasive cancers in women. 18.2% of all 
cancer deaths worldwide, including both males and females, are from breast cancer.</p>
					<p>
						Breast cancer rates are much higher in developed nations compared to developing ones. 
There are several reasons for this, with possibly life-expectancy being one of the key 
factors - breast cancer is more common in elderly women; women in the richest 
countries live much longer than those in the poorest nations. The different lifestyles 
and eating habits of females in rich and poor countries are also contributory factors, 
experts believe.
					</p>
					<p>
						A mature human female's breast consists of fat, connective tissue and thousands of 
lobules - tiny glands which produce milk. The milk of a breastfeeding mother goes 
through tiny ducts (tubes) and is delivered through the nipple.
					</p>
					<p>
						The breast, like any other part of the body, consists of billions of microscopic cells. 
These cells multiply in an orderly fashion - new cells are made to replace the ones that died. In cancer, the cells multiply uncontrollably, and there are too many cells, progressively more and more than there should be.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cancer that begins in the lactiferous duct (milk duct), known as ductal carcinoma, is the most common type. Cancer that begins in the lobules, known 
as lobular carcinoma, is much less common.

				<h2>What are the causes of breast cancer?</h2>
				<p>Experts are not sure what causes breast cancer. It is hard to say why one person develops the disease while another does not. We know that some 
risk factors can impact on a woman's likelihood of developing breast cancer.<p>
				<div class="text">
					<dl>
						<dt>Getting older</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- the older a woman gets, the higher is her risk of developing breast cancer; age is a risk factor. Over 80% of all female breast cancers occur among women aged 50+ years (after the menopause).</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Genetics</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women who have a close relative who has/had breast or ovarian cancer are more likely to develop breast cancer. If two close family members develop the disease, it does not necessarily mean they shared the genes that make them more vulnerable, because breast cancer is a relatively common cancer.</p>
							<p>The majority of breast cancers are not hereditary.</p>
							<p>Women who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a considerably higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. These genes can be inherited. TP53, another gene, is also linked to greater breast cancer risk.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>A history of breast cancer</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women who have had breast cancer, even non-invasive cancer, are more likely to develop the disease again, compared to women who have no history of the disease.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Having had certain types of breast lumps</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women who have had some types of benign (non-cancerous) breast lumps are more likely to develop cancer later on. Examples include atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Dense breast tissue</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women with denser breast tissue have a greater chance of developing breast cancer.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Estrogen exposure</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women who started having period’s earlier or entered menopause later than usual have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. This is because their bodies have been exposed to estrogen for longer. Estrogen exposure begins when periods start, and drops dramatically during the menopause.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Obesity</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- post-menopausal obese and overweight women may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Experts say that there are higher levels of estrogen in obese menopausal women, which may be the cause of the higher risk.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Height</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- taller-than-average women have a slightly greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than shorter-than-average women. Experts are not sure why.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Alcohol consumption</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- the more alcohol a woman regularly drinks, the higher her risk of developing breast cancer is. The Mayo Clinic says that if a woman wants to drink, she should not exceed one alcoholic beverage per day.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Radiation exposure</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- undergoing X-rays and CT scans may raise a woman's risk of developing breast cancer slightly. Scientists at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center found that women who had been treated with radiation to the chest for a childhood cancer have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>HRT (hormone replacement therapy)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- both forms, combined and estrogen-only HRTtherapies may increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer slightly. Combined HRT causes a higher risk.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Certain jobs</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- French researchers found that women who worked at night prior to a first pregnancy had a higher risk of eventually developing breast cancer.</p>
							<p style="font-style: italic;">Canadian researchers found that certain jobs, especially those that bring the human body into contact with possible carcinogens and endocrine disruptors are linked to a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Examples include bar/gambling, automotive plastics manufacturing, metal-working, food canning and agriculture. They reported their findings in the November 2012 issue of Environmental Health.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Cosmetic implants may undermine breast cancer survival</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>- women who have cosmetic breast implants and develop breast cancer may have a higher risk of dying prematurely form the disease compared to other females, researchers from Canada reported in the BMJ (British Medical Journal) (May 2013 issue).</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>The team looked at twelve peer-reviewed articles on observational studies which had been carried out in Europe, the USA and Canada.</p>
					<p>Experts had long-wondered whether cosmetic breast implants might make it harder to spot malignancy at an early stage, because they produce shadows on mammograms.</p>
					<p>In this latest study, the authors found that a woman with a cosmetic breast implant has a 25% higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer when the disease has already advanced, compared to those with no implants.</p>
					<p>Women with cosmetic breast implants who are diagnosed with breast cancer have a 38% higher risk of death from the disease, compared to other patients diagnosed with the same disease who have no implants, the researchers wrote.</p>
					<p>After warning that there were some limitations in the twelve studies they looked at, the authors concluded "Further investigations are warranted into the long term effects of cosmetic breast implants on the detection and prognosis of breast cancer, adjusting for potential confounders."</p>

				<h2>Breast Cancer Breakdown: Know the Signs</h2>
				<p>More American women are surviving breast cancer, thanks in part to screening tests that can help detect it early. But knowing your own breasts can help you spot changes and report them to your doctor between exams.</p>
				<div class="text">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/02.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>New Lump</b>
								<p>A new lump in or around your breast or armpit could signal breast cancer, but most lumps stem from other conditions. Some lumps are small fluid-filled sacs called cysts or non-cancerous changes in the fibrous tissue of the breast. Your doctor can order tests to determine whether a lump could be cancerous.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/03.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Changes in Breast Size or Shape</b>
								<p>Breast cancer can change the way your breasts look and feel, but so can age, your menstrual cycle, pregnancy, 
breastfeeding, weight changes and some medications. Your doctor can tell you whether any changes you notice 
could be cancerous and order tests to follow up.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/04.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Breast Swelling or Redness</b>
								<p>Not all breast cancers cause lumps. Inflammatory breast cancer can look more like an infection. Although it's very 
rare, inflammatory breast cancer is aggressive, so it's important to get any redness or swelling checked out right 
away.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/05.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Skin Flaking or Dimpling</b>
								<p>Inflammatory breast cancer can also cause changes in the skin of the breast, sometimes making it look like orange 
peel. The swelling stems from blocked lymphatic vessels in the skin, though the cancer usually starts in the lining 
of the milk ducts. Your doctor can determine whether changes to your skin could be signaling cancer.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/06.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Nipple Inversion or Discharge</b>
								<p>Breast cancer can also cause changes to the nipple. Talk to your doctor if your nipple turns inward or if you notice 
a discharge other than milk. In most cases, nipple changes do not signal cancer. But simple tests can help 
determine the cause.</p>

				<h2>7 Breast Cancer Fighting Foods</h2>
				<p>Breast cancer poses a major risk for many women, but the right diet can help to prevent it.</p>
				<div class="text">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/07.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Broccoli</b>
								<p>Eating broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables may improve your odds for breast cancer survival, a new study 
suggests. Of women in China diagnosed with breast cancer, those who consumed the most cruciferous vegetables 
were 62% less likely to die of breast cancer and 35% less likely to have a recurrence of the disease, compared 
with those who consumed the least.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/08.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Kohlrabi</b>
								<p>Kohlrabi is high in bioflavonoids, plant pigments that work with vitamin C and other antioxidants to prevent the 
cell damage that promotes cancer. Kohlrabi is also high in indoles, chemicals that reduce the effects of estrogen, 
and thus may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Isothiocyanates, another group of compounds in kohlrabi, promote 
the action of enzymes that may protect against colon cancer.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/09.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Whole Grains</b>
								<p>People with cancer are often advised to increase their carbohydrate intake and decrease fat intake, especially if 
they have cancers of the breast, colon, uterus, prostate, or skin. But make sure those carbs come from high-fibre 
and antioxidant-rich whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. A few studies suggest that refined carbs that cause blood 
sugar to spike may also feed cancer cells.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/10.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Sweet Potatos</b>
								<p>The famous Nurses' Health Study at Harvard Medical School found that women who ate lots of foods rich in 
beta-carotene, such as sweet potatoes, reduced their risk of breast cancer by as much as 25%.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/11.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Mushrooms</b>
								<p>Portobello and white mushrooms are good sources of selenium, which may help prevent prostate cancer. 
Additionally, mushrooms are rich in disease-fighting phytochemicals, and eating them regularly has been linked to 
a lower risk of breast cancer in Chinese and Korean women, according to studies.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/12.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</b>
								<p>The antioxidant phytochemicals hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein in olives and olive oil may work together, according 
to laboratory studies, to help protect against breast cancer. Lignans that are present in extra-virgin olive oil may 
protect against cancer by suppressing early cancer changes in cells.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<img src="{$img_dir}2013-breast-cancer/13.jpg" class="fl">
								<b>Flaxseed</b>
								<p>These small brown seeds are packed with fibre and loaded with lignans, which have been shown to slow down 
tumour growth in women with breast cancer. A 2007 study showed thatflaxseed reduced growth of breast cancer 
cells in mice. More human studies are still needed to find out if the effects hold true for humans.</p>
